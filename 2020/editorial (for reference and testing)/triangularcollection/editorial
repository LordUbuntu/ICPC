A set is valid if and only if the two smallest integers sum to an integer greater than the
largest integer in the set.

Therefore, we can brute force over the two smallest integers and the largest integer,
and then every integer in between the second smallest integer and largest integer
can be optionally included - if there are $K$ such integers and the set is valid,
then we increment the answer by $2^K$.
