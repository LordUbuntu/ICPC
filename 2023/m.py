# Resturaunt Opening Problem
# The fourth problem, solved at the 1h48m mark.
# Solution:
#   While we thought be could have solved this more elegantly with maybe a graph algorithm or a dp one, we realized that with the size of input (50), and the worst-case time complexity of a brute force solution (O(n**3)), we decided to just brute force a solution instead, calculating the best value for each location and returning the best one.
