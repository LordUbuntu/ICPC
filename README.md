# ICPC

Solutions to past ICPC problems that I solved with friends.

## 2021 D2

I competed in my first ICPC D2 regional in 2021. Our team was called "Code to Joy". The team consisted of:
* [Jimmy Kha](https://github.com/JamesKha) :otter:
* [Yaacov Kochatkov](https://github.com/yaacovkdev) :mammoth:
* [Jacobus Burger](https://github.com/LordUbuntu) :snake:

We competed sort-of-online from campus since there were still concerns that year.

We won [7th place](http://www.acmicpc-pacnw.org/scoreboard/2022/group10.html) in our local region, which was awesome!



## 2023 NAQ

On Feb 4, 2023 we competed in the North American Qualifier hosted by ICPC ([as seen on kattis](https://naq22.kattis.com/contests/naq22/standings?filter=4651)). Me and my friends competed together as the team "Neural Notwork". The team consisted of:

* [Yaacov Kochatkov](https://github.com/yaacovkdev) :question:
* [Finian Lugtigheid](https://github.com/DaSpikeyBos) :owl:
* [Jacobus Burger](https://github.com/LordUbuntu) :snake:

To see our solutions, go to the [NAQ22](https://github.com/LordUbuntu/ICPC/tree/main/NAQ22) directory!

We completed 5 problems in the 5 hours given in the contest. With our training and teamwork we were already doing great!


## 2023 D2

This was my second go at ICPC, but this time in person at UBC as is more like ICPC tradition! Our team is named "Neural Notwork". The team consists of:

* [Yaacov Kochatkov](https://github.com/yaacovkdev) :question:
* [Finian Lugtigheid](https://github.com/DaSpikeyBos) :owl:
* [Jacobus Burger](https://github.com/LordUbuntu) :snake:

Our solutions to the practice set (which we completed in totality) can be found in the [2023 Practice](https://github.com/LordUbuntu/ICPC/tree/main/2023_PACNW_practice) directory. To see our solutions to the contest itself, go to the [2023](https://github.com/LordUbuntu/ICPC/tree/main/2023) directory!

We competed in person on UBC campus February 25, 2023. We did incredibly for ourselves. During the contest, we were tailing the first place team in D2, _at one point placing **2nd**_ in the contest. We solved 5 problems in the first 2 hours, our pace was awesome! In the end, we placed **11th** in the final rankings for D2 for the entire Pacific Northwest Regionals. That's _11th out of 60+_!!! We improved a ton since the NAQ in preaparation for the contest, practicing problems together in preparation, improving our communication and problem solving skills together as a team! During the study week we met every day for about 3 hours to practice, learning new techniques and algorithms like sliding window, DP, Greedy, Divide and Conquer, Graph, and many many more!
