# ICPC

Solutions to past ICPC problems that I solved with friends.

## 2021 D2

I competed in my first ICPC D2 regional in 2021. Our team was called "Code to Joy". The team consisted of:
* [Jimmy Kha](https://github.com/JamesKha) :otter:
* [Yaacov Kochatkov](https://github.com/yaacovkdev) :mammoth:
* [Jacobus Burger](https://github.com/LordUbuntu) :snake:

We competed sort-of-online from campus since there were still concerns that year.

We won [7th place](http://www.acmicpc-pacnw.org/scoreboard/2022/group10.html) in our local region, which was awesome!



## 2023 NAQ

On Feb 4, 2023 we competed in the North American Qualifier hosted by ICPC ([as seen on kattis](https://naq22.kattis.com/contests/naq22/standings?filter=4651)). Me and my friends competed together as the team "Neural Notwork" representing TWU. The team consisted of:

* [Yaacov Kochatkov](https://github.com/yaacovkdev) :question:
* [Finian Lugtigheid](https://github.com/DaSpikeyBos) :owl:
* [Jacobus Burger](https://github.com/LordUbuntu) :snake:

## 2023 D2

This year will be my second go at ICPC, but this time in person at UBC as is more ICPC tradition! Our team tentatively has the name "Neural Notwork". The team will consist of:
* [Yaacov Kochatkov](https://github.com/yaacovkdev) :question:
* [Finian Lugtigheid](https://github.com/DaSpikeyBos) :owl:
* [Jacobus Burger](https://github.com/LordUbuntu) :snake:

We will be competing in person on UBC campus February 25.

We're aiming high (1st place in the local region).
