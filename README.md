## 2021 D2

I competed in my first ICPC D2 regional in 2021. Our team was called "Code to Joy". The team consisted of:
* [Jimmy Kha](https://github.com/JamesKha) :otter:
* [Yaacov Kochatkov](https://github.com/yaacovkdev) :mammoth:
* [Jacobus Burger](https://github.com/LordUbuntu) :snake:

We won [7th place](http://www.acmicpc-pacnw.org/scoreboard/2022/group10.html) in our local region, which was awesome!
